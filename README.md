# Clustering algorithms on  generated Statical datasets
We have implemented GMM on four generated datasets with 10000 samples: 1)having three same mean and different standard division, 2) having three different mean and same standard division and 3) three different mean and standard division. Moreover, we have developed ‫‪DBSCAN‬‬ ‫‪,‬‬ ‫‪Fuzzy‬‬ c-means and Kmeans‬‬ on these datasets.
